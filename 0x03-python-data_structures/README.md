# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
* What are lists and how to use them
* What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
* What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
* How to use lists as stacks and queues
* What are list comprehensions and how to use them
* What are tuples and how to use them
* When to use tuples versus lists
* What is a sequence
* What is tuple packing
* What is sequence unpacking
* What is the del statement and how to use it

**Exercises**

**0. Print a list of integers**

     Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

* Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
* Format: one integer per line. See example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use str.format() to print integers

**1. Secure access to an element in a list**

     Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like on C.

* Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
* If idx is negative, the function should return None
* If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the
  function should return None
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use try/except

**2. Replace element**

     Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific
     position (like in C).

* Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
* If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and
  returns the original list
* If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function
  should not modify anything, and returns the original list
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use try/except

**3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!**

     Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

* Prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
* Format: one integer per line. See example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use str.format() to print integers

**4. Replace in a copy**

     Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position
     without modifying the original list (like in C).

* Prototype: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
* If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
* If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function
  should return a copy of the original list
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use try/except

**5. Can you C me now?**

     Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

* Prototype: def no_c(my_string):
* The function shoud return the new string
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use str.replace()

**6. Lists of lists = Matrix**

     Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

* Prototype: def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):
* Format: see example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use str.format() to print integers

**7. Tuples addition**

     Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

* Prototype: def add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()):
* Returns a tuple with 2 integers:
* The first element should be the addition of the first element of each argument
* The second element should be the addition of the second element of each argument
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the two tuples will only contain integers
* If a tuple is smaller than 2, use the value 0 for each missing integer
* If a tuple is bigger than 2, use only the first 2 integers

**8. More returns!**

     Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its
     first character.

* Prototype: def multiple_returns(sentence):
* If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None
* You are not allowed to import any module

**9. Find the max**

     Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

* Prototype: def max_integer(my_list=[]):
* If the list is empty, return None
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use the builtin max()

**10. Only by 2**

      Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

* Prototype: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
* Return a new list with True or False, depending on wether the integer at the
  same position in the original list is a multiple of 2
* The new list should have the same size as the original list
* You are not allowed to import any module

**11. Delete at**

      Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

* Prototype: def delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0):
* If idx is negative or out of range, nothing change
* You are not allowed to use pop()
* You are not allowed to import any module

**12. Switch**

      Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b

* You can find the source code here
* Your code should be inserted where the comment is (line 4)
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

**13. Linked list palindrome**

      Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

* Prototype: int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
* Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome
* An empty list is considered a palindrome
