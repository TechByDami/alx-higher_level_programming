# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))

* Why Python programming is awesome
* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using print
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
* What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

This folder contains a basic introduction of the python programming language.
